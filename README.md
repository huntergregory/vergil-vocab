# vergil-vocab
Latin homework just got easy. Automate creating a vocab list for any passage from a Latin Library text.

Currently uses the requests module to communicate with both the Latin Library and Whitaker's Words. 

Eventually hope to have persistent memory of "known" words that won't appear in a newly produced vocab list.
