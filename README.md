# vergil-vocab
Latin homework just got easy. Automate creating a vocab list for any passage from a Latin Library text.

## Current Status
Currently uses the requests module to communicate with both the Latin Library and Whitaker's Words. 
Shout out to Jerry Liu who recently added scansion functionality for dactyllic hexameter.

## Plans
Eventually hope to have persistent memory of "known" words that won't appear in a newly produced vocab list.
